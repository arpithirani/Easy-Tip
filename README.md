**Easy Tip** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Arpit Hirani**

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [✔️] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [✔️] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [✔️ ] UI animations
* [  ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [✔️ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [✔️] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [✔️] Implemented Dark Mode in the settings view.
* [✔️] Implemented Bill splitting using stepper for number of people.

## Notes

This was my first using Swift to do a project. Prior to this I had no experience in Swift. But using CodePath resources and Swift tool guide I could accomplish various additional features like dark mode, app icon, settings page, stepper, switch and many more. Here I decided to go with the same UI as the given example as I did not want to spend more time designing the UI. I wanted to explore more about different features that I can implement in order to improve the app and gain more knowledge about Swift. At last I want to say that I enjoyed this project and I hope that I get the opportunity to learn about Swift and extend my skill set.
